# Work Day Schedule

## Description
I built this application in order to have a simple workday planner. It will aid users in staying organized for whatever may go on in their work day schedule. I learned more about using Bootstrap and jQuery to create this scheduler.

## Usage
1. Type in what you have to do in each time block.
2. Hit the save button and your to-do item will be listed.
3. If you leave the page, Your work day schedule will still be available and like you left it when you return to the page.
